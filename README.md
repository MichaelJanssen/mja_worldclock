# Web worldclock application

An easy to use worldclock without advertising.

Click somewhere on the map for a new timezone in that region.

@todo: get rid of the search anti feature. Could remove the entire
sidebar, which doesn't really help but makes it more cluttered on
mobile. On the other hand the search is the only reliable way to find
timezones that are not easy to find by clicking in the map. Perhaps
simply move the search below the fold.
